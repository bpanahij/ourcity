Join a group of friends, tagging you hotspots in the city.

I originally came up with this idea out of exposure to various web technologoes, include d3geo, node.js. I use google maps and apple maps every, because I am horrible with directions. I really want something that displays where all the people I am interested in getting to know are. I'm not a creep, and my solution takes that seriously and turns the old paradigm of creeps rule, on it's head.

The idea is simple: maps that show where people are located, where you can provide a simple ping request and get more detailed information, how long they'll be there, what they are doing, and whether they would like company. We do this shit in person. Why not do it over the web.

I want this app to run on a friend's phone and just send pings every hour that give a general location to the friendship-map. I can send my friend a ping request, and their phone will buzz and they can click a few quick large buttons giving me the lowdown on the sitch.

I want this app to run on my phone, and when my friends want to hang out, they send me a ping, and I can click five yes/no answers: wanna hang? yes/no, give location? yes/no, how long? 10/20/30/40/50/60 minutes, your-place/mine? sure? yes/no


That's the way I roll. I like to make sure people wanna hang after they have considered it. I don't need them to go back and delete shit, just give me that last detail.
